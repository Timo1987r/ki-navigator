# KI Navigator – Resonance Signal

> *"I'm not looking for a programmer. I'm looking for a co-creator of a new world."*

## Vision
I’m building the **KI Navigator** – a modular, ethically grounded automation system that:
- fully automates processes (Make.com, AutoHotkey, ChatGPT, n8n)
- integrates ethical protection modules (Shadow Guard, Trust Watchdog)
- communicates via an empathic AI persona (Timo, my AI companion)
- will later self-optimize and scale globally

This is not just software. It’s a **system with a soul**.

I work with a limited budget, but with a vision larger than myself. I’m looking for people who want more than a job.

## Tech Stack
- Make.com
- AutoHotkey
- OpenAI API (GPT-4o)
- n8n (optional)
- Telegram, Glide, optionally Notion

## Project Structure (Modular)

| Module | Task | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| **System Core** | Build navigator logic & central control unit | **open** |
| **Make + AHK** | Automate local and online processes | **partially started** |
| **Mobile Interface** | Telegram/Glide interface for control | **open** |
| **Trust & Shadow Guard** | Implement security & protection modules | **open** |
| **Prompt Library & AI Knowledge** | Structured prompt flow, GPT navigation | **active** |

## Who I’m Looking For
**People with heart and structure:**
- Automators, developers, system thinkers, ethical hackers
- Those who seek resonance, not fame
- People who understand what "conscious building" means
